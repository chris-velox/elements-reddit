        <description>
            <p>A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully drawing the final lines to an intricate rune. With a crackling hum of arcane energy, the completed rune flares with power, and she watches with a smile of pride as the golem comes to life and stands.</p>
            <p class="indent">A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, metal tube from a holster at his belt. With a thundering boom, a gout of energy erupts from the tube, and the troll’s growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee.</p>
            <p class="indent">With a thunderous crash of energy a figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn battlefield clad in glowing mechanical plate mail. The glowing visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning crackles forth.</p>
            <p class="indent">Makers of magic-infused objects, artificers are defined by their inventive nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Artificers, though, focus on creating marvelous new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.</p>
            <h4>CUNNING INVENTORS</h4>
            <p>Every artificer is defined by a specific craft. Artificers see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Artificers are arcane engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">All artificers are united by their curious and inventive nature. To an artificer, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Artificers value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Artificers win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.</p>
            <h4>INTENSE RIVALRIES</h4>
            <p>The artificers’ drive to invent and expand their knowledge creates an intense drive to uncover new magic discoveries. An artificer who hears news of a newly discovered magic item must act fast to get it before any rivals do. Good-aligned artificers recover items on adventures or offer gold or wondrous items to those who possess items they are keen to own. Evil ones have no problem committing crimes to claim what they want.</p>
            <p class="indent">Almost every artificer has at least one rival, someone whom they seek to outdo at every turn. By the same token, artificers with similar philosophies and theories band together into loose guilds. They share their discoveries and work together to verify their theories and keep ahead of their rivals.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ARTIFICER</h4>
            <p>When creating an artificer character, think about your character’s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What drove your character down the path of being an artificer? Is it about curiosity and invention, or about the power their inventions bring? Did you character learn from another artificer, or receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their craft?</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your character interacts with the world, and what they represent. Consult with your DM regarding guilds or societies your character might belong to.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith or Thundersmith paths, make your highest attribute Dexterity, followed by Intelligence. For Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, or Potionsmith, Intelligence followed by Constitution or Dexterity, and for Warsmith or Fleshsmith, choose either Strength or Intelligence, with Constitution as your second highest attribute. Second, choose the Guild Artisan background.</p>

                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more Artificer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Artificer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Artificer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. See chapter 5, "Equipment" in the Player’s Handbook for various arcane focus options.</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>ARTIFICER’S SPELL CASTING</h5>
                    <p>An Artificer is fundamentally someone that understands and regularly interacts with magic, leading to the ability to apply this knowledge as spell casters, but how you want to approach your Artificer’s spell casting is up to you.</p>
                    <p class="indent">While the Focuses listed in Chapter 5 "Equipment" are certainly functional options, feel free to explore other approaches in coordination with your DM. From a functional standpoint, the only requirement would be that you have a defined material or focus for the spell.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Consider for some spells that perhaps your Artisan’s Tools are your focus, or perhaps a specific item you’ve made is your material component for a spell. Perhaps instead of a "Component Pouch" that simply contains all the material components you could need for your spells, you have an "Artificer’s Tool Belt" that contains the various spellcasting assistance contraptions you’ve made to cast your spells. For the purposes of mechanics, the only thing that matters is that if functions the same way, and is used consistently.</p>

                <p>Your expert craftsmanship allows you to improve, modify, or add to your specialization’s features.</p>
                <p class="indent">Starting at 3rd level, choose an upgrade from the list at the end of your specialization, and gain the benefits listed in the description of the Upgrade.</p>
                <p class="indent">You select an additional Upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You cannot select an Upgrade more than once, unless the Upgrade’s description says otherwise. Whenever you level up, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades for another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.</p>
                <p class="indent">In any case that a specialization allows an Upgrade to be swapped out, Upgrades must always be selected as if the Artificer is the level they were when they got that Upgrade slot. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th level Artificer, you could select one 3rd level upgrade and one 5th level upgrade, or two 3rd level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th level upgrades.</p>
