        <description>
            <p>An Infusionsmith is, in some ways, perhaps the most quintessential type of Artificer. While other Artificers may delve into mechanics and tinkering, an Infusionsmith is an artificer that tinkers with magic itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">These are cutting edge of magical engineering, understanding the principle applications of magic. An Infusionsmith would have ground to stand on in calling a wizard an impulsive spell slinger, for these are the artificers that work their magic through careful and meticulous method, laying down magic they may not use for hours, or painstakingly crafting a long lasting enchantment.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Infusionsmith can be magical swordsman, a wandslinger, or bookish supporting character with a bag full of tricks that never quite runs dry. Some will stand within a maelstrom of animated blades while others will plink away with a crossbow that seems unerringly accurate, but their common theme is using their prowess of infusion to make themselves formidable.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you can infuse a powerful armament to take into battle. At the end of a long rest, select one of the Infusions below. The infusion lasts until the end of your next long rest.</p>
            <h5>ANIMATED WEAPON</h5>
            <p>You touch a melee weapon, causing it to spring to life. An animated weapon can be carried or stowed, but while readied, it floats beside you. While an animated weapon is readied, as an action you can make a melee spell attack with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">If this attack hits, it deals the weapon’s damage dice + your Intelligence modifier. The range of this attack is 30 feet, with that range reduced to 15 feet if the weapon has the Heavy property and increased to 60 feet if the weapon has the Light property.</p>
            <h5>BLASTING ROD</h5>
            <p>You touch a nonmagical wand-blank, stick, staff, or rod, infusing with the ability to cast a cantrip. Select one Evocation Cantrip from the Wizard spell list that does not require concentration. Thereafter, as an action, you can use the Blasting rod to cast that cantrip.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with your Blasting Rod, you can add your Intelligence modifier to damage dealt to that target.</p>
            <h5>INFUSED WEAPON</h5>
            <p>You touch a weapon, enchanting its effectiveness. While this weapon is enchanted, you - and only you - have proficiency with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Infused Weapon can be wielded like a normal weapon, but gains the following property: you can apply your Intelligence modifier to the to attack and damage roll of the weapon where you usually apply your Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">If an Infused Weapon has a single damage die, and that damage die is less than a d12, the damage die of the Infused Weapon is increased (for example, a dagger’s damage die would go from a d4 to a d6).</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 3rd level, you have a Spell Manual containing two 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your Spell Manual is the repository of any non-Artificer spell you know.</p>
            <p class="indent">You cannot cast these spells and they do not count against your spells known, but when you would learn a new Artificer spell, you can select that spell from a spell in Spell Manual instead of the Artificer spell list, at which point you can cast it as normal. You can choose to scribe any Artificer spell you can cast into the Spell Manual, as if copying from a written spell.</p>
            <h5>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>Each time you gain a artificer level, you can add one wizard Spell of your choice to your Spell Manual for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots, as shown on the Artificer table.</p>
            <p class="indent">On your adventures, you might find other Spells that you can add to your Spell Manual. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gold pieces.</p>

            <description>You can cast spells from your Spell Manual if you have learned them as an Artificer spell. You can add additional spells to your Spell Manual for 2 hours and 50 gp for each level of the spell.</description>

            <p>When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can infuse the weapon with arcane energy as a bonus action to deal 3d4 additional force damage. When infusing the weapon in this way you can expend a 1st level spell slot to increase the damage further. The extra damage is 3d4 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 2d4 for each spell level higher than 1st.</p>

            <p>When you create an Arcane Armament at the end of a long rest, you can create two different Infused Armaments (you cannot select the same option twice); if you use your action to use one to attack or cast a cantrip, you can make a single attack with the other as a bonus action (a single Animated Weapon attack, or a single attack with your Infused Weapon).</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you use your action to cast a cantrip with your Blasting Rod, you can use your bonus action to make a single animated weapon attack, or if you use your action to attack with your Animated Weapons, you can make a single Infused Weapon attack.</p>
            <h5>SPELLSWORD’S TECHNIQUE</h5>
            <p>You can make a Blasting Rod that allows you to cast booming blade, and consequently use Mixed Technique to cast booming blade, attacking with your Infused Weapon in your other hand, and then attack with your bonus action.</p>

            <p>You learn a potent magical infusion that suffuses a creature with life energy. You can cast <em>regenerate</em> without expending a spell slot. Once you cast this spell in this manner, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.</p>

            <p>You create a new Rod that you can infuse with a spell of 5th level or higher you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This rod does not require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell level must be equal to half or less of your Artificer level (as of when you would get this upgrade), rounded down. This rod has one charge. You can expend the charge to cast the selected spell at its base level. The rod regains all charges at the end of a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can select this upgrade multiple times, selecting a different spell each time you take this upgrade.</p>
            <h5>HOW TO GET HIGH LEVEL SPELLS?</h5>
            <p>Astute players will note that you can only add spells of a level you can cast through leveling to your Spell Manual, but you cannot cast a 5th level spell until higher level than Magical Rod upgrade becomes available. Spells for Magical Rods will primarily have to be found in the wild, in the form of scrolls, and copied into your Spell Manual that way.</p>
