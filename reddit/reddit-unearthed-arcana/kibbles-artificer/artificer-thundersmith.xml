        <description>
            <p>A Thundersmith is an Artificer has harnesses the primal force of elemental power, channeling its power into their great creation: a weapon of unmatched devastation. Spectacular and terrible, these weapons bring fear to their foes and awe to their allies.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why an Thundersmith bends their mind to the task of making such a thing - some are coldly analytical about the destruction it causes, seeking to continually improve it, tweaking it for ever more optimized destruction, while others view it merely as a tool, a means to an end, while others still reveal in the crash of thunder that heralds the terrifying force of their weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">While some may look at these weapons as the dawn of a new age, in truth wielding them is a tricky and arcane art no simpler than making them, something only the one who forged the device will every truly master, each weapon a unique piece of devastating art.</p>

            <p class="indent">If your weapon requires ammunition, you gain the knowledge of how to forge them, and create them with smithing tools during a long rest. You can create up 50 rounds of ammunition during a long rest, with materials costing 1 gold piece per 10 rounds.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, you harness the power of elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement and you proficient with it while attuned. and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (eight hours each day) by expending 200 gold pieces worth of metal and other raw materials. When you make a new Stormforged Weapon, you can make the same or different type, and select the same or different upgrades.</p>
            <p class="indent">Select one of the following and consult the Thunder Powered Weapon table for its statistics.</p>
            <h5>THUNDER CANNON</h5>
            <p>You use the power of Thunder to launch a projectile with terrible power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.</p>
            <h5>HAND CANNON</h5>
            <p>Forgoing the guiding barrel, this packs uses the thundering power to launch a projectile with all the force of a Cannon, though its effective range is far more limited.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>FIREARMS IN A CAMPAIGN SETTING</h5>
                <p>A lot of campaign settings do not feature firearms, and in some of these the Thundersmith variant of Artificer might not be the right choice, but consider that the Artificer is fundamentally someone that tinkers with and explores boundaries of magic as much as or more so than technology.</p>
                <p class="indent">A Thunder Cannon need not be a gunpowder powered device, even in a setting where gun powder exists, but can be powered by harnessing elemental powers, bound through various carefully researched magical techniques. In most cases, the wonders of an Artificer are more an engineering marvel of magic than technology, but that balance can shift depending on what is best for your setting.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>KINETIC HAMMER</h5>
            <p>Rather than launching a projectile with the thundering force, you keep that force imbued in the weapon, allowing for devastating force to be applied to the attack.</p>
            <h5>CHARGED BLADE</h5>
            <p>You create a bladed weapon that channels the harnessed power of the elemental storm power directly into the blade, causing it to lay waste to all it strikes. This weapon deals Lightning damage when applying Thundermonger.</p>
        </description>
