            <p>You touch a piece of worn armor or clothing and imbue it with magic. The creature wearing this the imbued item gains 4 temporary hit points for the duration. When these temporary hit points are exhausted, at the start of the creature's next turn it will gain 3 temporary hit points. This repeats when those temporary hit points are exhausted as the previous total minus one, until no temporary hit points would be gained and the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels: The initial temporary hit points increases by 1 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
