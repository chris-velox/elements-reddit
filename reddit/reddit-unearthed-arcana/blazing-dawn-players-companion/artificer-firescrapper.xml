            <p>As the name implies, firescrappers specialize in the use of pyromantic magic. They are quite unlike wizardly pyromancers, however, as they use this magic to become powerful front-line fighters rather than back-line mages. In the Last War, efforts of firescrappers turned the tides of many a battle, and they were highly valued assets of many different armies. Since the war’s conclusion, the demand for these artificers has decreased dramatically, but there are still many that learn and pass on the techniques of this specialization.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 3rd level, you learn how to craft magical, technologically enhanced gauntlets that make for brutally effective weapons. Creating a pair of these magical gauntlets takes an hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest, and requires the use of smith’s tools and 30 gp of materials. Creating your first pair of gauntlets is free. The gauntlets are specially designed for your body, and are ineffective when used by other creatures. They are considered martial melee weapons with which you are proficient. They deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit, have the light property, and you use your Intelligence modifier for their attack and damage rolls. Also, when you engage in two-weapon fighting with these gauntlets, you can add this modifier to the damage of the secondary attack. Though the gauntlets are magical, they can still be infused.</p>
                <p class="indent">While wielding these gauntlets, you can use your bonus action to activate them. Once you activate the gauntlets, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as an alternative way to activate them. If you spend a slot of 2nd level or higher, the first time you hit a creature with the activated gauntlets you deal an additional 1d6 fire damage to the target for each slot level above 1st.</p>
                <p class="indent">The gauntlets remain activated for up to 1 minute. When you hit a creature with one of your activated gauntlets, you can choose to have the gauntlet deal an additional 1d6 fire damage or lightning damage to its target (you choose when you activate the gauntlets). However, when you do so, each of your gauntlets become heated until the end of the turn. If you choose to deal this bonus damage while your gauntlets are heated, they become overheated. This causes the target to take 3d6 additional fire or lightning damage, rather than 1d6, and each creature in a 15-foot cone behind the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your artificer spell save DC, as heat is expelled from your gauntlets in a blast of energy. A creature takes 3d6 fire or lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After your gauntlets overheat, they deactivate and cannot be activated again for the next minute.</p>
