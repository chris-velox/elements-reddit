        <description>
            <p>The Oath of Cinders was first taken in an age long past, not long after the time man first harnessed the power of fire. The paladins that take this oath are sometimes called pyre knights, red knights, or ashen knights, as their oath grants them command over the element of fire. They are known for their limitless bravery and unwillingness to back down from a losing fight, as they attempt to keep the flame of hope alive no matter the circumstances. Many paladins that take this oath are revolutionaries, fighting against tyranny and protecting the oppressed.</p>
            <h5>Tenets of Cinders</h5>
            <p>The tenets of the Oath of Cinders inspire a paladin to always take action and never back down in the face of evil.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fan the Flames. </em></strong>A flame left unattended will surely go out. By leading through example and never backing down, you can keep your ideals and hopes alive.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rekindle the Flame. </em></strong>A flame that once burned can burn again. When hope starts to dwindle, be the one that reignites it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Be the First Spark. </em></strong>A powerful flame can be born from a single spark. In the face of evil and tyranny, be the first to rise against it and bring change.</p>

                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Branding Blade.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you transform a melee weapon you’re holding into a flaming weapon, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, the weapon’s damage type becomes fire, and it emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 10 feet beyond that. Also, the fire damage dealt by this weapon ignores fire resistance if its target is a fiend or undead.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature becomes branded until the end of your next turn. If a branded creature attacks a creature other than you, the brand flares, dealing 1d8 fire damage to it. Also, if the branded target is a fiend or undead, its speed is halved and it can’t take reactions for as long as the brand lasts.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>From the Embers.</em></strong> When a creature within 30 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction and your Channel Divinity to cause their body to burn away into ash. When you do so, some of the burnt embers fly back to you and imbue you with power. For the next minute, you have resistance to fire damage and gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier at the start of each of your turns.</p>

                <p>At 20th level, you can take the form of an elemental knight of primordial fire. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hostile creatures within 10 feet of you that have resistance to fire damage lose that resistance. Creatures within the area that have immunity to fire damage are instead treated as if they had resistance to it.</li>
                    <li>Once during the duration, you can use one of your Channel Divinity options without needing to spend a use of your Channel Divinity. This does not allow you to combine the effects of the same Channel Divinity if its used multiple times.</li>
                    <li>When you use your Divine Smite, it deals fire damage to its target, rather than radiant damage. Also, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target, other than the target, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your paladin spell save DC or take fire damage equal to the damage dealt by your smite (not including any bonus damage dealt from a critical strike or vulnerability, or other damage increasing effects).</li>
