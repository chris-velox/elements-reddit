        <description>
            <p>The Oath of Radiance is almost as old as the sun that it follows, and has remained a steady force of good over the ages. Often called sun warriors or shining knights, paladins that take this oath seek to bring light and knowledge to even the darkest areas of the world. Some of them adorn their armor with dazzling inlaid glass and brilliantly bright metals, so that they can reflect the sun’s glory and become physical beacons on the battlefield. They also might wear images of the sun or stars—the holy lights that bring life and knowledge to this world, and reveal all that is hidden by shadows and darkness. Like a star in the night, a paladin of the Oath of Radiance seeks to be a light of truth in the dark.</p>

                <p>Though those that take this oath do so for an array of reasons, they generally all follow these core tenets:</p>
                <p class="indent">Truth. Like a light in the dark, you must reveal the truth when it is shrouded in mystery.</p>
                <p class="indent">Leadership. You must become a beacon of light that everyone else follows, and lead others along the right path.</p>
                <p class="indent">Preservation. Where the light glows strongest, you must be ready to stand in its defense.</p>
                <p class="indent">Knowledge. Those that are ignorant to the truth must be shown the light. Spread your knowledge to all those that would accept it.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Blinding Intervention.</em></strong> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to teleport to an unoccupied location within 5 feet of a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for up to 1 minute. The creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also, other creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you after you teleport must also make Constitution saving throws. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Sunlight.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to exude an aura of light. As an action, you can cause your body to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 10 feet beyond that for 1 minute. This light is sunlight, and it reveals the true form of shapechangers and creatures altered through magic. Additionally, magical darkness does not function within the area of bright light.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also, fey, fiends, and undead within the bright light have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you reach 7th level, the radius of the bright light increases to 20 feet, with dim light extending 20 feet beyond that.</p>
