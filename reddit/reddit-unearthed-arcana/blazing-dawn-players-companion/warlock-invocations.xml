            <p>Upon completing a long rest, you can summon a pact scepter in your empty hand. This scepter counts as an arcane focus, and it lasts until you complete your next long rest. When you summon the scepter, you also choose two spells on the warlock spell list of a level you have warlock spell slots for. You can cast each of the chosen spells using your warlock spell slots. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t cast it again until you resummon your pact scepter at the end of your next long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Also, the scepter gives you an alternative way to cast spells at a higher level. Whenever you would cast a spell using a warlock spell slot of a higher level than the spell, you can choose to gain 5 temporary hit points for each slot level above the spell’s base level. This is decreased to 3 temporary hit points per level if the spell has a casting time of 1 bonus action or 1 reaction. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. If the spell already benefits from being cast at a higher level, you can choose to gain the temporary hit points, gain the spell’s regular benefits, or gain a combination of the two choices.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 9th level warlock and cast shatter using one of your 5th level warlock spell slots, you can choose to gain 15 temporary hit points and have the spell deal 3d8 damage. You can also choose to gain no temporary hit points and have the spell deal 6d8 damage, or gain 5 or 10 temporary hit points and have the spell deal 5d8 or 4d8 damage, respectively.</p>
