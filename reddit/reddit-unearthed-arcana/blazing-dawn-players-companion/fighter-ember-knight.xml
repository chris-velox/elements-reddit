        <description>
            <p>An ember knight employs martial techniques combined with potent fire magic. While ember knights are often mistaken for the more common eldritch knights at first glance, the source of an ember knight’s magic comes from within, rather than from the study of magic. In this way they bare some resemblance to sorcerers. While the potential to become an ember knight might be within someone from birth, this potential typically doesn’t manifest until that person has a few battles under their belt. This event is generally referred to as an ember knight’s “awakening,” where they first begin to wield their fiery powers.</p>
            <p class="indent">Ember knights make for impressive combatants, capable of clearing out groups of enemies with the explosive blades they conjure, or merely cutting down their foes with weapons wreathed in flame. Their presence can inspire fear in their opponents, and awe in their onlookers.</p>
            <p class="indent">These warriors can easily find employment in times of war, where their magical capabilities can be used to wade through the tides of battle. Many become mercenaries, or even leaders of mercenary groups, and their services are often highly sought after. Anyone that employs an ember knight finds them to be worth their price.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, the pyromantic magic within you lets you imbue flames into your weaponry. This feature has 3 uses when you gain it, and the number of uses increases as you gain levels in this class. The feature has 4 uses at 7th level, 5 at 10th level, 6 at 15th level, and 7 at 18th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. You can spend these uses in the following ways:</p>
                <p class="indent"><em><strong>Burning Blade.</strong></em> As a bonus action, you can spend a use of this feature to ignite a weapon you’re holding for 10 minutes. While the weapon is ignited, it deals an additional 1d4 fire damage on a hit, and emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light 10 feet beyond that.</p>
                <p class="indent"><em><strong>Bursting Blade.</strong></em> When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more of your attacks. For each attack you forgo, you must spend a use of this feature to summon a fiery blade and send it streaking towards a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The blade explodes upon reaching its destination, destroying the blade, igniting unattended flammable objects within the area, and forcing each creature within 5 feet of the blade to make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 fire damage. If a creature is in the area of multiple explosions, that creature makes separate saving throws for each explosion.</p>
