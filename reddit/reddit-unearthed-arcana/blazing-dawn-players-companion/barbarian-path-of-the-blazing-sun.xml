            <p>There are many cultures, particularly in the harsh outlands that many barbarians call home, that revere the power of the sun. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Blazing Sun take this reverence a step further, and learn to how to transform and harness this power. These barbarians transform their rage into a dazzling display of magic, where powerful flames leap from their weapons and their movement becomes impossible to track as they disappear in a flash of light only to reappear moments later, ready to strike down their foes with radiant energy.</p>
            <p class="indent">Barbarians who draw on the power of the sun are versatile fighters, capable of clearing groups of enemies with ease. In a display of their reverence, these barbarians typically adorn themselves with tattoos and markings that represent the sun, and often adorn their clothing with these symbols as well.</p>

                <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, the burning rage in your heart manifests as white-hot fire and dazzling radiance. While you rage, you can charge the first attack you make each turn with either fire or radiance. The weapon’s damage type for the attack becomes fire or radiant, respectively, and it gains a secondary effect, outlined below:</p>
                <p class="indent"><em><strong>Fire.</strong></em> In addition to your primary target, you can choose up to two secondary targets that are also within your weapon’s reach. If the attack hits its primary target, flames arc onto the secondary targets. If the attack roll that was made against the primary target would also hit a secondary target, that secondary target takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + half your Barbarian level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><em><strong>Radiance.</strong></em> Your reach for this attack is increased by 15 feet. Immediately after you declare your attack’s target, you disappear in a flash of light. You then reappear at an unoccupied location within 5 feet of the target, and complete the attack. If there is no space available within 5 feet of the target, you remain at your original location and the attack fails. In order to select this option, your speed can’t be 0.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 6th level, the warm touch of the sun can invigorate you. When you take a short rest and spend the entire rest in sunlight, you regain an additional 1d6 hit points if you spend at least one hit die during the rest, and you are provided with enough nourishment to sustain yourself for one day.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also, you gain both the control flames cantrip and the light cantrip if you don’t already have them. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is Constitution.</p>

                <p>At 10th level, you learn to form the radiance and fire of your soul into a separate entity—a mighty steed. You can cast the phantom steed spell, but only as a ritual. For you, this spell summons a semi-transparent steed made from light and fire. The steed sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light 10 feet beyond that.</p>

                <p>At 14th level, when a creature within your weapon’s reach hits you with an attack while you’re raging, you can use your reaction to cause magical energy to streak towards your attacker. Choose fire or radiance. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. It then suffers one of the following effects:</p>
                <p class="indent"><em><strong>Fire.</strong></em> The creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
