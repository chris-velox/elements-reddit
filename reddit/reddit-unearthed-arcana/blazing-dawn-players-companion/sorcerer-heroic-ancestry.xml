        <description>
            <p>Your innate magic comes from your connection to an ancient hero—an ancestor of yours that defeated mighty foes and reached the peak of physical ability. In the years beyond their death, your ancestor’s deeds have been immortalized by history, and their bloodline has been blessed by the gods. Through your blessed blood, you can channel the abilities of your ancestor, mimicking their unmatched strength and prowess. Most of these bloodlines are well-established, and deeply connected to royal or noble blood. Some of these bloodlines have been obscured by time, however, and many sorcerers of this origin have no knowledge of their history. Not all members of a heroic bloodline awaken this magic, so it can remain hidden for generations and slowly forgotten before suddenly re-emerging.</p>
            <p class="indent">Oftentimes, these bloodlines are plagued with conflict. The enemies of your ancestor might become your enemies, as they seek revenge for the deeds of the past or recognize you as a threat to their continued existence.However, you might also find friends due to your lineage. Creatures or societies that knew your ancestor might be willing to offer you assistance as repayment for the great deeds your ancestor did for them.</p>

When you use this reaction, you can spend up to 2 sorcery points to empower it. For every sorcery point you spend, you roll an additional d4.</p>
