        <description>
            <p>Strong and proud, guardrins are the descendants of guardinal and human parents. They are touched by the divine power of elysium, a beautiful plane of rolling hills and flowering meadows that the mighty guardinals call home. Guardrins are not often born in this plane, however. They are usually born on the material plane, as the result of a guardinal traveling there during their missions to ward off evil. Once they come of age, guardrins are expected to take up the mantle of their celestial parent, and do their part in smiting evil and protecting those weaker than them. They are a noble race, as strong and graceful as the animals they resemble.</p>
            <h4>ANIMALISTIC CHAMPIONS</h4>
            <p>A guardrin’s appearance takes after its guardinal parent, granting it an animalistic form similar to that of a true guardinal. Like their celestial parents, the degree of animalism in their appearance varies greatly. Some guardrins look like humans, but with a light covering of fur over parts of their bodies, and a few distinguishing features like horns, claws, or fangs. Other guardrins more closely resemble animals, and look just like beasts that have learned to walk on two legs and wear clothing.</p>
            <p class="indent">Guardrins are typically tall and muscular, though their exact height varies among their different varieties. More human-like guardrins are usually beautiful to behold, and even the more animalistic ones resemble only the most magnificent members their corresponding species. Even the most beastial members typically hold some resemblance to their human parent, such as a shared eye color, hair color, or other identifying feature.</p>
            <h4>GENTLE ALLIES, RUTHLESS ENEMIES</h4>
            <p>Though guardrins are compassionate and gentle to their friends, they are merciless to all that commit evil. Their disposition can change quickly as the situation commands it, with calm tranquility quickly transitioning to blind anger when evil rears its ugly head. They have no qualms with killing those that have commited evil, especially those that have killed innocents.</p>
            <p class="indent">When it comes to close friends and family, guardrins are fierce protectors and loving companions. They value these close connections above all else, and will fight to protect them even when they are clearly outmatched. When it comes to their friends, guardrins are selfless and willing to sacrifice their lives for them.</p>
            <h4>WANDERING WARRIORS</h4>
            <p>When they come of age, guardrins typically leave home and wander the world, searching for those that would need their help and companionship, and rooting out evil wherever they find it. Guardrins have a natural inclination towards adventuring, and are usually quite good at it. Their strong sense of justice oftens leads them to become heroes, celebrated far and wide for their great deeds. They fight against oppression, dethrone tyrants, and become champions of moral causes.</p>
            <h4>GUARDRIN NAMES</h4>
            <p>Guardrins typically grow up with their non-celestial parent, and therefore use human naming conventions. They often have more atypical names, however, and might be given names themed around the beast they share features with.</p>
            <h4>GUARDRIN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a guardrin, you have a multitude of traits inherited through your celestial lineage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score and Charisma score each increase by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Guardrins mature at a rate slightly slower than humans, and reach adulthood around the age of 30. They live far longer than ordinary humans, with many living for over three centuries. Many die in battle before reaching old age, however.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most guardrins are neutral good, though any good alignment is common. They are kind and loyal almost as a rule, and have no tolerance for evil acts. While it is possible for a guardrin to turn to evil, it is exceptionally improbable and is practically unheard of.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Guardrins vary in size, though most are at least 6 feet tall, with some standing up to 8 feet tall. They usually weigh more than a human of the same height, thanks to their muscular build. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Animal Kinship.</em></strong> You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with beasts, and most beasts are naturally friendly towards you. Beasts can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all checks made to influence them, and they are unlikely to attack you unless provoked.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your bestial eyesight allows you to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Root Out All Evil.</em></strong> You can cast <em>detect evil and good</em> with this trait, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability for it. Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subraces.</em></strong> Six subraces of guardrin exist, one for each of the guardinal varieties. Choose one of them for your character, based on the variety of guardinal you chose for your celestial parent.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Avoral guardrins resemble the cross between a majestic, golden eagle and a human. Their faces are usually more human than avian, but their hair resembles a feathery cowl, and their eyes are bright and golden. They have feathered, wing-like arms, and their legs end in wickedly sharp talons. They are proud creatures, though more solitary than most other guardrins.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Far-sighted.</em></strong> Your normal eyesight remains effective for twice the range of normal humanoids, allowing you to discern fine details as though you were looking at something half as far away.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Talons.</em></strong> The long, sharp talons on your feet make for an effective natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Your unarmed strikes with your talons use a d4 as their damage die, and deal slashing damage rather than the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed attack.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Underdeveloped Wings.</em></strong> While you don’t have true wings, your feathered, winglike arms can help you glide and buffer your falls. You take half as much damage from falling, and you take no damage from falls less than 30 feet. For every 2 feet you fall vertically, you can also move 1 foot horizontally.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Wind Magic.</em></strong> You know the <em>gust</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>

            <p>Cervidal guardrins are the most peaceful of their kind, and resort to violence far more rarely than their kin. They bear a striking resemblance to satyrs, with goat-like horns and hooves for feet. They are slim yet strong, and their thick skin is often at least partly covered by short fur in shades of red or brown.</p>

            <p>Leonal guardrins resemble proud, humanoid lions, with impressive manes and golden fur. Their powerful arms end in claws that are as strong and sharp as swords, and perhaps more deadly.

            <p>Lupinal guardrins are half-man and half-wolf with lean, rangy physiques and pronounced muzzles filled with canine teeth. Their legs are bent like a wolf’s, and they are covered in silver-grey fur. They are often mistaken for werewolves, but their well-groomed visage and strict loyalty set them apart from most lycanthropes. Most of them are highly driven in their fight against evil, and become quickly bored by mundane tasks.</p>

            <p>Ursinal guardrins are hulking men and women with bearlike attributes. They stand approximately 8 feet tall and are covered with golden, red, or brown fur. Their faces have pronounced muzzles and high ear tufts—and, usually, a kindly expression. Despite their intimidating looks, they are scholarly creatures that often seek to avoid physical confrontations, though they are capable combatants when push comes to shove.</p>
