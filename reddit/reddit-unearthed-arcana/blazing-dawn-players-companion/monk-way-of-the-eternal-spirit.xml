        <description>
            <p>Monks of the Way of the Eternal Spirit learn to channel the energy of the positive plane, using the powers that it grants to defend their allies and come to the aid of those that need it most. Unlike the monks of most monastic traditions, monks of the way of the eternal spirit don’t typically live in monasteries or cloisters. Monks that follow this tradition are wanderers that travel through the lands, and sometimes even across planes, as they train and lend their aid to those they encounter. It is common for these monks to travel in small groups, where a single master leads and teaches one to three students.</p>
            <p class="indent">Monks of this tradition are often easily identifiable by the intricate, magical tattoos that they adorn their bodies with. These tattoos are thought to improve their connection to the positive plane, so that they can more easily channel its energy. When a monk of this tradition harnesses their ki, their tattoos can change color or even begin to glow.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, you can manipulate your ki to come to the defense of your allies. You gain the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a bonus action, you can cause a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to gain temporary hit points equal to your Martial Arts die. When you use this option, you can choose to spend up to 3 ki to increase the number of temporary hit points gained by one Martial Arts die per ki point spent. These temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When another creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction and spend 1 ki point to disappear in a flash of light. You teleport to an unoccupied location within 5 feet of that creature, and grant it resistance to the triggering instance of damage. When you do so, you take damage equal to the damage that creature takes.</p>
                        <p class="indent">When you use this option, you can choose to spend 2 ki points, rather than 1. If you do so, you don’t take damage equal to the damage the creature takes.</p>
                        <p class="indent">If you are within 5 feet of your target when you use this option, you can choose to not teleport. In that case, the total ki cost for this option decreases by 1.</p>

                <p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to commune with those you meet, and come to their defense in their time of need. You can, for 1 minute, touch your palm to the chest of a willing creature that speaks at least one language to grant them your protection. As long as that creature is under your protection, you know the distance and direction to their location, and you can sense their current emotional state and whenever they take any damage. You can have up to six creatures under your protection at any one time, and a creature remains under your protection until you choose to end it (no action required), or if they are ever on a different plane of existence as you.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, you can spend 10 ki points to teleport yourself and up to eight willing creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you to the location of one of the creatures under your protection. You and the creatures you transport with you appear in unoccupied locations within 60 feet of the targeted creature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you teleport in this way, you can’t teleport to a target more than 5 miles away from you until you finish a long rest.</p>
