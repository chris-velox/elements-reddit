            <p>The gods of the hunt value skill above all else—whether it be skill as a tracker of cunning prey, a slayer of mighty beasts, or a marksman of unparalleled accuracy—it does not matter. Deities of this domain include Malar, Balinor, Sekolah, Artemis, and Uller. While rangers are often the most common servants of these deities, most of gods of the hunt employ clerics as well. The clerics of a hunting god often take a more active role in advancing their god’s interests, compared to rangers. Followers of this domain might defend sacred groves and shrines to their god from the assault of evil monstrosities or hunt down the enemies of whatever deity they follow.</p>

                <p>Also at 1st level, you can channel the divine power of the hunt into your weapon attacks. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use this feature to apply a secondary effect to your attack. The secondary effect depends on whether the triggering attack was a melee or ranged attack.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can magically reward a creature for their successful kill. When a creature within 120 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to reward the creature that reduced it to 0 hit points. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Cleric level, and can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. An undead or construct cannot be healed by this feature.</p>

                <p>Starting at 6th level, your weapon attacks begin to hit unerringly, aided by the divine magic flowing through you.

Alternatively, if you hit with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to deal additional damage to the target.

Additionally, whenever you make a weapon attack with advantage and hit, if the lower of the two rolls would also hit then the attack deals an additional 1d8 damage and pushes its target up to 10 feet away from you.</p>
