        <description>
            <p>An archetypical Devout bears a distinct resemblance to paladins and clerics, particularly in the way they present themselves. While they lack the divine magic offered by these classes, their divine fervor and unshakeable devotion to their gods are far from lacking. A Devout fights for their deity, commonly acting as crusaders or, less commonly, inquisitors of the faith. These fighters come from all walks of life, united by their zealotry and unbreakable faith. In their training, they become capable combatants, devoted friends, and learned scholars of their faith. A Devout’s way of life is arduous—they are always fighting for something, whether for their god, their companions, or a moral cause. They fully devote their mind and body to defending their allies and slaying their foes, as they can take on an almost trance-like demeanor during battle.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, you can devote yourself to a cause. As a bonus action, you can devote yourself towards either defender of kin or slayer of foes.
