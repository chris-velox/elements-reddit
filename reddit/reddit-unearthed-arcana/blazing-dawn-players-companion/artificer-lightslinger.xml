        <description>
            <p>A Lightslinger learns how to harness magical, radiant energy and put it to use in their weaponry. These artificers create complex machines that channel and focus light, turning that energy into powerful beams that can sear their foes. These machines come in multiple varieties, each with a distinct purpose and common name. The aurum blaster is the generalist weapon, and also the most defensive weapon, considering its common pairing with a shield. The bolt shooter is a long range weapon, capable of outranging longbows and taking out targets with powerful, focused blasts. The lux cannon is a short ranged weapon, capable of hitting multiple foes at once.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though lightslingers were relatively uncommon in the time of the Last War, those that did exist made versatile combatants that were an asset to any army. Capable both as front-line soldiers and back-line artillery, these artificers are well respected warriors.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can magically construct one of the following weapons: an aurum blaster, a lux cannon, or a bolt shooter. If you already have a weapon constructed, you must transform that weapon into a new type rather than constructing a new one. After you gain this subclass, the first weapon you construct is free. If you lose your weapon, however, replacing it requires 50 gp of materials. Transforming your weapon is always free. You are proficient with these weapons, and you use your Intelligence modifier for their attack and damage rolls. They function by channelling your inner magic, and thus cannot be wielded by other creatures. Each of these weapons have the following special property:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Recharge (X).</em></strong> Only X attacks can be made with a weapon that has the recharge property before it needs to be recharged. A weapon can be recharged as a bonus action (even if it still has charges left), but it cannot be recharged on the same turn it is used to make an attack.</p>
                <p class="indent">The weapons’ other properties are detailed in the following table:</p>

                <p>The lux cannon’s special property is described below:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Special.</em></strong> You do not make attack rolls with this weapon. Instead, your attacks with it shoot blasts of radiant energy that fill a line 5-feet wide and 10-feet long extending from you. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Artificer spell save DC or take the damage of this weapon.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, you can expend spell slots to temporarily empower the shots of your Lightsmith weapons. When you recharge one of these weapons, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. Until the weapon is next recharged, it has the following enhanced effects, based on the weapon’s type:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Aurum Blaster.</em></strong> Attacks made with the weapon deal additional radiant damage on a hit: 1d4 for a 1st level slot, 1d6 for a 2nd level slot, 1d8 for a 3rd level slot, 1d10 for a 4th level slot, and 1d12 for a slot of 5th level or higher.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bolt Shooter.</em></strong> Attacks made with the weapon explode in a burst of light. Hit or miss, the target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your artificer spell save DC or take 2d4 radiant damage for a 1st level slot, plus 1d4 for each spell level higher than 1st.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Lux Cannon.</em></strong> The area of effect of attacks made with the weapon become cones, rather than lines, and any creature that fails its save against this weapon is pushed up to 5 feet away from you and knocked prone. The cone’s size is equal to the line’s length. Also, if you use a slot of 2nd level or higher, the weapon’s damage is increased by 1d4 for each spell level higher than 1st.</p>
