        <description>
            <p>Druids of the Circle of Flames recognize fire’s integral role in the natural world—they see it not only as a force of destruction, but as a force of rebirth, and ultimately of life. Throughout many environments, wildfires are merely a tool of nature that allow plants and animals to thrive. These druids seek to control and manipulate wildfires, allowing them to run their course without encroaching on civilization. Their order gathers in the burnt out remnants of forest fires, where they discuss their dealings and sow the first seeds of new growth within the charred soils.</p>
            <p class="indent">These druids also devout much of their time to studying the most ancient forms of fire magic, created by creatures of primordial fire and those connected to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Through their study, they learn an array of fire-based magics, and gain the ability to infuse their wild shapes with the destructive power of fire.</p>
            <p class="indent">Members of this circle become adventurers in their search knowledge, as they travel far and wide in search of ancient tomes and primordial beings, so that they might gain a deeper understanding of fire magic and the beings that created it. They also might seek to punish those that abuse and misuse fire—pyromaniacs are not welcome among their kin, and cannot be allowed to bring unbalance to the natural world.</p>

                <p class="indent">Additionally, you learn to infuse your wild shape with primordial fire. When you use your Wild Shape, you can choose to expend two uses of the feature, rather than one. When you do so, your Wild Shape becomes empowered in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You gain resistance to fire damage.</li>
                    <li>You can speak Ignan and Primordial, regardless of your form’s speaking limitations.</li>
                    <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to the hit point maximum of your Wild Shape form. These temporary hit points last for the duration of your Wild Shape.</li>
                    <li>You can cast certain spells during this Wild Shape: the bonus cantrip you gained from this subclass, and the circle spells you gain from subsequent levels in this class.</li>

                <p>Your connection to fire infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to your circle spells.</p>

If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

                <p>At 10th level, after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, magical ashes swirl around you in a 10-foot radius area centered on you for the next minute. The area travels with you, and it is difficult terrain for hostile creatures. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to have the ashes dissipate into healing energy, causing the area to return to normal. One creature within the area regains hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier plus 1d10 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</p>
