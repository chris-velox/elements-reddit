            <p>You have made a pact with an ancient sphinx born in a bygone age, a being made manifest through the power of devout prayer or the direct intervention of the gods. Such beings are tasked with guarding the secrets and treasures of the gods, and revealing those secrets to those that pass their trials and show their worth. One such treasure that a sphinx can impart is the power of magic. Through your completion of a Sphinx’s trial, you have gained access to powerful magic that augments your mind and body.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, or Religion.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also, you can call upon your patron to grant you knowledge about a creature you designate. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For 1 minute, you are granted foreknowledge about that creature’s intentions, allowing you to better engage it both socially and in combat. This effect ends early if the target dies, you die, or if you are incapacitated. Until the effect ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the target hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.</li>
                    <li>When you fail a saving throw inflicted by the target, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to that saving throw, potentially causing the saving throw to succeed.</li>
                    <li>You can add your Intelligence modifier to the result of any Charisma check or Wisdom (Insight) check you make when interacting with the target.</li>
                    <li>When you use this feature on a target, you can specify some small tidbit of knowledge you wish to gain from the creature. If the target dies and is capable of providing this knowledge, you are granted it in the form of a few cryptic sentences or a riddle. This knowledge is based on what that creature knew in life, and could therefore be false if that creature was misinformed or left unanswered if the creature didn’t have that knowledge.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Beginning at 10th level, you can use this feature twice between rests, and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

                <p>At 10th level, your mind becomes as inscrutable as a sphinx’s. You are immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts, and any Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain your intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.</p>

                <p>Starting at 14th level, you can unleash a terrifying roar that echoes around you. As an action, you can force each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you to make Constitution saving throws against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 thunder damage, falls prone, and is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.</p>
