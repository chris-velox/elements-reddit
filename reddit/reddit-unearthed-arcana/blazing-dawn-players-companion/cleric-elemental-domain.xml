            <p>Clerics of the Elemental domain are unique among their peers, as they often worship a group of deities, rather than focusing their prayers in the worship of only one god. This domain includes gods of fire, such as Kossuth or Sirrion, gods of water and oceans, such as Umberlee or Poseidon, gods of the earth, including Ulaa and Skadi, gods of air and storms, including Talos and Zeus, and other such deities. These clerics might devote themselves to any number of these gods, but they typically focus their worship on one or two of these deities, and specialize their magic accordingly. While some might train themselves in all them elemental magics equally, most clerics of this domain tend to value some elements above others. They might become masters of fire, devote themselves to learning the ins-and-outs of earth magic, or otherwise specialize Themselves. Gods of this domain tend to be less involved with their clerics than those of other domains, but when they give out a decree their followers are usually quick to respond.</p>
