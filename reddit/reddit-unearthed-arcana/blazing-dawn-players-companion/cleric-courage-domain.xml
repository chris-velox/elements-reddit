            <p>The Courage domain focuses on personal heroics, and acts of valor and self-sacrifice. While the Courage domain bears many similarities to the War domain, it is more individualistic and isn’t directly connected to war. Clerics of this domain often take part in smaller conflicts, and focus on personal battles over grandois wars. Many war-like deities can claim influence over this domain, however, including Torm, Heironeous, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah. Gods of endurance and loss, such as Ilmater and Shar, can claim some influence over this domain as well, as they promote courage in the face of hardship. Regardless of their patron deity, clerics of this domain make for heroic warriors, eager to face their fears and fight against the odds to achieve their goals.</p>

                <p>Also at 1st level, you can unleash your divine will in a burst of radiant energy. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal 1d6 bonus radiant damage. When you do so, you also force each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target (not including the target) to make a Constitution saving throw.

While undaunted, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and you can use Force of Will without expending a use, even if you have already expended all of your uses of that feature.</p>
