            <p class="flavor">Item: a length of chain or rope of at most 100 feet</p>
            <p class="indent">Upon its infusion, this item begins to emit dim light out to a range of 5 feet. While holding this item, a creature can telepathically command the cord to move as its wielder desires. As an action, the cord’s wielder can have the cord tie itself to a creature or object that it can reach. If the target is a creature, it can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the cord, becoming tied by it on a failed save. A creature tied by the cord must make a Strength saving throw whenever it attempts to move away from the creature holding the rope for the first time on a turn. On a failed save, the creature is unable to move away from the creature holding the rope until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it can move away from that creature at half speed until the start of its next turn, pulling the rope’s holder along with it. The creature can also use its action to make a Strength saving throw, releasing itself from the rope on a successful save. The rope’s holder can also choose to release the creature at any time (no action required). The DCs of all of these saving throws equals the spell save DC of the artificer that infused this item.</p>

            <p class="indent">While holding this item, a creature gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. Also, the wielder of this item can use its bonus action and expend a spell slot to cause a blade of radiant energy to emerge from the tip of this item. For up to 1 minute, the item becomes a simple melee weapon with the finesse property and a +1 bonus to its attack rolls. If the infused item is a staff, it also has the reach and two-handed properties. It deals 1d8 radiant damage on a hit if the slot used is of 1st level. The damage is increased to 2d8 for a 2nd or 3rd level slot, 3d8 for a 4th or 5th level slot, 4d8 for a 6th or 7th level slot, or 5d8 for a slot of 8th level or higher.</p>
            <p class="indent">The effect ends early if the item leaves its wielder's hands.</p>
