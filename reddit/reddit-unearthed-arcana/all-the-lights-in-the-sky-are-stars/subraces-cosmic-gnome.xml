            <h4>NOT SO DIFFERENT</h4>
            <p>Cosmic gnomes live quiet and reclusive lives. The few that do encounter them often mistake them for their rock or forest counterparts, due in part from the visual similarities they share with them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Cosmic gnomes retain some of the tinkering prowess that their rock gnome counterparts are renowned for, directing these talents toward the development of astrolabes and telescopes to further their astronomical research.</p>
            <h4>EYES TO THE SKY</h4>
            <p>Cosmic gnomes are defined primarily by their intense focus toward the heavens. Utilizing their longevity, a single cosmic gnome can study and record the motion of planets and stars in the sky for hundreds of years. Their findings often spearhead developments in meteorology and astral magics.</p>
            <h4>SEERS AND SCHOLARS</h4>
            <p>The depth of a cosmic gnome’s knowledge grants it foresight that some find nearly magical. Many become seers or esteemed astrognomers, highly sought after as advisors by royal courts for their divinations</p>

                <span class="feature">Age.</span> Cosmic gnomes enjoy relatively long lifespans compared to their forest counterparts. They mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 60. They can live 500 to almost 800 years.<br />
                <span class="feature">Alignment.</span> Cosmic gnomes study the laws that govern the astral bodies, and tend towards lawful alignments.<br />
