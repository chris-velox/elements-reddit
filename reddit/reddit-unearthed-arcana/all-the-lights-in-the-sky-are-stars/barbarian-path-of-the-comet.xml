            <p>Blasting across the battlefield in a shell of fire and ice, barbarians who follow the path of the comet are blessed with tremendous speed and power. As with the celestial voyagers that pass overhead, so too do these warriors put on brilliant displays, engraved in the hearts and minds of those that witness them.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you channel the power of comets when you slam into enemies. While you are raging, you can surround yourself with a layer of either fire or ice. When you shove a creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier plus your rage bonus damage if you win the contested ability check. The damage is cold or fire; you choose the type of damage when you begin your rage.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, the cosmic powers you emulate allow you to barrel through your opponents. While you are raging, when you move straight towards a creature and then make a melee weapon attack or shove, the creature takes an additional 1d6 damage for each 10 feet you move straight toward it before the attack or shove, up to a maximum of 3d6. This maximum increases to 4d6 at 6th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 6d6 at 14th level. The damage is the same type as your Coldfire Slam.</p>

            <p>At 6th level, your speed empowers your ability to leap. While you are raging, your jump distance is tripled, and you do not take fall damage from a height of less than 100 feet.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, your charge is nigh unstoppable. When you take the Dash action, you can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures. Each creature you move through must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, they are knocked prone.</p>
