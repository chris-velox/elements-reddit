        <description>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to accelerate the impact of your blows for maximum effect. Once per turn, whenever you deal more than 10 damage to a creature with a melee attack using a weapon that deals bludgeoning damage, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw or suffer one of the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The creature is knocked prone.</li>
                <li>The creature is pushed 10 feet away from you.</li>
                <li>The creature drops one object of your choice that it is holding, which lands at its feet.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">The DC for these saving throws is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to brace against otherwise devastating blows. As a reaction to taking more than 10 damage, you can hold strong against the impact and reduce the damage by 1d10. This increases to 2d10 at 10th level, 3d10 at 15th level, and 4d10 at 18th level.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <p>At 7th level, you can daze an opponent with your blows. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee attack using a weapon that deals bludgeoning damage, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your Heavy Hitter save DC. On a failed save, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>

            <p>At 15th level, you learn to channel your strikes in a destructive wave. As an action, you can slam the ground with a weapon that does bludgeoning damage. Each creature within 10 feet of you that is not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Heavy Hitter save DC. A creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not knocked prone on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you use this feature immediately after falling, the damage dealt by this feature increases by 1d6 for every 10 feet you fell.</p>
