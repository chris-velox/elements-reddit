            <p>The gods that govern the sky are held in high regard by many religions. Deities of the sky include Zeus and Tyr, among various others. Followers of these deities often travel far to sate their wanderlust and feel the beauty of the open sky</p>

            <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the winds. You learn the <i>gust</i> cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it gains the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One Large or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be flung up 20 feet away from you and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</li>
                <li>You create a blast of air capable of moving one object that weighs no more than 100 pounds. If the object is being held or carried, the holder must make a Strength saving throw or lose hold of it. The object is pushed up to 60 feet away from you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a powerful blast of wind. As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Choose a Large or smaller creature within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be blown upwards 30 feet. A target can choose to automatically fail this saving throw. If the target doesn’t have a hover or fly speed, it immediately falls afterwards, taking fall damage and landing prone.</p>
