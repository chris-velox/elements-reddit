            <p>You condense gravity into an immeasurably dense orb at a point you can see within the spell’s range. The orb fills a 10-foot radius sphere around it with darkness, which no light, magical or mundane, can illuminate. </p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature enters within 30 feet of the orb for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward the orb. When a creature enters within 5 feet of the orb for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">The orb’s gravitation makes moving away from it incredibly difficult. While within 10 feet of the orb, a creature moving away from the orb must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. While within 30 feet of the orb, a creature moving away from the orb must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pulled into orb. Small nonmagical objects that come within 5 feet of the orb are immediately destroyed.</p>

            <p>You can cast this spell only at night. You memorialize a dead creature you touch, turning it into a constellation, provided that it has been dead no longer than 1 day. The target’s body dissolves into stardust and rises into the sky.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as <em>raise dead</em>. A spell that targets the dead but usually require a body can be cast targeting this constellation instead, provided the spell is cast at night and the caster can see the target’s constellation. If the target of this spell is returned to life, this spell ends and the constellation fades.</p>

            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Familiarity.</strong></em> "Very familiar" is a creature or place you have met with or been to very often, a creature or place you have carefully studied, or a creature or place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen casually" is someone or someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar. "Viewed once" is a creature or place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a creature or place whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.</p>
            <p class="indent">"False description" is a creature or place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you scried an illusion, or you are attempting to locate a familiar creature or location that no longer exists. </p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>On Target.</strong></em> The star appears directly over the target’s location.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Off Target.</strong></em> The star appear a random distance away from the target’s location in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance between you and the target. For example, if the target was 120 miles away from you, and the DM rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then the star would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Similar Target.</strong></em> The star appears over a different target that’s visually or thematically similar to the target. Generally, the star appears over the closest similar target, but since the spell has no range limit, it could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Mishap.</strong></em> The star appears in your hands and then explodes. Each creature within 30 feet of the star must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You materialize a minor moon from its place in the stars to use as an instrument of doom. A large stone moon of 100-foot radius appears 1500 feet above a point you can see within range. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air where the moon could appear, or if you do not have a clear view of the sky.</p>
            <p class="indent">The moon falls 500 feet at the start of each of your turns. Each creature in the moon’s path as it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is grappled until the end of its next turn, pinned by the moon. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed out of the moon’s path, up to 100 feet away from the moon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the moon collides with the ground, each creature within 100 feet of the point of collision takes 12d12 bludgeoning damage. The spell deals maximum damage to structures. The moon then break into pieces, leaving a 100-foot radius impact crater, which becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>

        <description>
            <p>With a wave of your hand, you force the sky above you to clear and become night, in a radius of 1 mile. Within the spell’s area, spells that can be cast only at night (such as <em>create undead</em>) can be cast regardless of time of day.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell, choose one of the following effects. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to choose an effect, selecting the same effect or a different one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Dreamland.</strong></em> The terrain within the spell’s area shapes to your desires. The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain. You can end this effect as an action on your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Grim.</strong></em> You imbue false life into a corpse you can see within the spell’s area. It rises as a skeleton if you choose a pile of bones, or a zombie if you choose a fleshy corpse. On each of your turns, you can use an action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within the spell’s area (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature reverts to a corpse or pile of bones when the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Shooting Star.</strong></em> A star streaks across the sky. One creature of your choice who can see the star gains 25 temporary hit points. While the creature has these hit points, it immune to fear.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Slumber.</strong></em> You inflict drowsiness on a creature of your choice within the spell’s area. If the target has less than 50 hit points, it fall unconscious until the spell ends, it takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>Star Storm.</strong></em> Ten stars fall from the sky. Each star hits a creature of your choice within the spell’s area. Each star deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target (roll damage for each star separately). The stars all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. Each time you use this effect, the sky grows darker. After the 10th use, the sky above becomes entirely dark, and you can no longer use this effect.</p>
