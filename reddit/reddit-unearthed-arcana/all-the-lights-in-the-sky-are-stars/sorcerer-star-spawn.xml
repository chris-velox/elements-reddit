        <description>
            <p>Star Spawn sorcerers inherit their magic from the mysterious creatures of the same name from the far reaches. Their magic is one of spatial manipulation and psychic energies, allowing them to move and cast spells in unpredictable and disruptive ways. The birth of a Star Spawn sorcerer occurs in the wake of a comet passing overhead, and forebodes the arrival of Elder Evils.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to move through material space. You can use a bonus action on your turn to become partially ethereal. Until the end of your turn, you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Each creature you move through takes 1d10 psychic damage; no creature can take this damage more than once per turn. You take 1d10 psychic damage if you end your turn inside an object.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to collapse distance. As an action, you can spend one sorcery point to force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to be forcefully warped. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failed save, the target, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, is magically teleported up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. A willing creature can choose to fail this save.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, as a reaction to being hit by an attack, you can spend one sorcery point to negate the damage and magically teleport yourself to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the madness of the Elder Evils, confounding and disorienting those around you. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to exude an aura of madness to a distance of 60 feet. Each creature within this area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC or go insane. While insane, it can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. You can choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier to automatically succeed the saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>
