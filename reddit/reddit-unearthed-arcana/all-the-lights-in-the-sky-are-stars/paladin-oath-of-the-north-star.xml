        <description>
            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Soothing Light.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity to call out to your allies, reassuring and bolstering them. As a bonus action, choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum one creature) within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your paladin level and is immediately freed from the frightened or charmed conditions.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Stellar Glow.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to surround yourself in stardust. You emit dim light in a 5-foot radius for one minute. Attacks made at creatures within this dim light (including you) are at advantage. You can end this effect as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
