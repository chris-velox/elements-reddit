            <p>Monks that follow the traditions of the Way of the Void look to the spaces between the stars for inspiration in their techniques. Their training emphasizes emptiness of mind and body, and monks of this tradition spend long hours in fasting and meditation.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you learn the techniques of the void. You gain the following abilities:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Suffocate.</b> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one ki point to attempt to knock the air from its body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has the air knocked from its body, begins suffocating, and can’t breathe until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Vacuum Pull.</b> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one ki point to create a vacuum centered on the target. Each creature other than you within 10 feet of the target must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet toward the target and take bludgeoning damage equal to your Martial Arts die.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Deflect Spell.</b> When you take damage from a spell, you can expend one ki point and use your reaction to reduce or nullify the magic. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier + your monk level.</p>
