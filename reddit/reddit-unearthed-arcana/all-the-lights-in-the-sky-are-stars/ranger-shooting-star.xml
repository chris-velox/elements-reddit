            <p>Rangers of the Shooting Star conclave emulate the brilliant displays of astral bodies streaking across the sky. Their arrows strike with the intensity and variety of these extraterrestrial phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn to conjure motes of starlight. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to conjure motes of starlight that encircle you. You conjure three motes with a 1st-level spell slot, creating one additional mote for each spell level higher than 1st. You can have a number of motes equal to your ranger level. Any additional motes you create disappear. These motes last until they are used or until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you have one to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 20-foot radius.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can expend a mote to make a ranged spell attack that you can use with the Attack action. The attack has a range of 120 feet, and on a hit the target takes 2d6 radiant damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you learn the three Shooting Star techniques.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Illuminate.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can expend a mote to imbue a piece of ammunition with starlight. The ammunition sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius until the end of your next turn, after which it returns to normal. When you hit a creature with this piece of ammunition, it takes an additional 1d6 radiant damage, sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius until the end of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against it before the end of your next turn has advantage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Scattered Sparks.</i></b> As an action, you can expend a mote and launch it at a point within 120 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases to 3d6 at 7th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 15th level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Comet Shot.</i></b> When you miss a ranged weapon attack or ranged spell attack, you can expend a mote to use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target. On a hit, the attack deals an additional 1d6 radiant damage.</p>
