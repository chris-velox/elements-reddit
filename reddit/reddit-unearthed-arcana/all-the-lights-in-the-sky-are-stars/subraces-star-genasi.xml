            <p class="flavor">"My mother once told me a story about the stars, heavenly entities that guide us from above, constantly watching over us from the night sky. She told me she’d met one once. I had thought she was joking."</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">— Cecelia Winnows, Astrognomer</p>
            <h4>NEBULOUS ORIGINS</h4>
            <p>The star genasi are born from the wishes of a mortal upon a star. They are the might and mind of heavenly bodies, and draw their power from the glowing core they carry in place of a heart, a shard of their parent star. This core grants them the power to illuminate the dark.</p>
            <h4>OTHERWORLDLY APPEARANCE</h4>
            <p>Star genasi are strange creatures, with dark-blue skin that blends with the night sky and eyes containing the light of thousands of galaxies. They have silvery hair that shimmers with starlight in the light of day, the specks of light that infuse their skin and hair becoming less pronounced during the daytime. However, their eyes still bear the light of countless stars.</p>
            <h4>STAR GENASI NAMES</h4>
            <p>Star genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume the names of constellations or stars, such as Orion, Polaris, or Vega. Some take on more vague names to reflect their origins, such as Nebula, Nova, or Starlight.</p>
            <h4>STAR GENASI TRAITS</h4>
            <p>When you create a genasi character, you may choose the star genasi as an alternative to the subraces in the <i>Elemental Evil Player’s Companion</i>.</p>
