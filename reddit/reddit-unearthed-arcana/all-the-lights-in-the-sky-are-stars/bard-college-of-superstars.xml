            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you hone your ability to shine as a performer.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you perform for at least 10 minutes, you can attempt to inspire awe in your audience by singing, acting, dancing, or speaking. At the end of your performance, choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each creature gains a d4 Bardic Inspiration die. This die lasts for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), instead of 10 minutes. Using this feature does not expend any uses of your Bardic Inspiration.</p>
