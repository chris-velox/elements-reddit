            <p>Forged from a fallen star in the fires of its violent impact, this hammer is always accompanied by the faint smell of burning ozone.</p>
            <p class="indent">You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">This weapon has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to intensify the weapon’s weight, driving it downwards with tremendous force. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can expend 3 charges to cast <i>reverse gravity</i> (save DC 18), centered on yourself. When you cast the spell in this way, you are immune to the spell’s effect, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.</p>

            <p>A glittering golden star-shaped pendant on a silver chain, this necklace grants its wearer the power to manipulate small lights. While attuned to the necklace, you can cast the <i>dancing lights</i> cantrip. The lights appear as tiny diamonds, no matter what angle they’re viewed from. Once per day, you can cast the <i>daylight</i> spell, targeting the necklace. Once you use the necklace this way, you can’t do so again until the next dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A Gargantuan metallic whale weighing 5000 pounds, this apparatus has a hidden catch on the top of the whale’s head, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch into an airlock, through which the apparatus’ main compartment can be accessed. The apparatus fits two Large creatures or eight Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row inside the main compartment, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down.</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Armor Class: </strong>20</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points: </strong>500</li>
                <li><strong>Speed: </strong>swim 60 ft., fly 60 ft.</li>
                <li><strong>Damage Immunities: </strong>poison, psychic</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’ hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 100 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
            <p class="indent">The apparatus is built to survive the perils of space, and can travel through a complete vacuum with no ill effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Skyfish Apparatus Levers table.</p>

While it is charging, the apparatus emits dim light in a 10-foot radius around its mouth if the mouth is closed, or a 60-foot cone of bright light and 60 feet of dim light beyond that if the mouth is open. The beam can remain charged for 1 minute, afterwards it must be recharged if not fired.</td><td>The apparatus fires a beam. If the mouth is closed, the beam fizzles, and the apparatus takes 72 (16d8) radiant damage. If the mouth is open, each creature in a 100 foot line, 5 feet wide, in front of the apparatus must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 72 (16d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</td></tr>
