        <description>
            <p>Monks of the Way of the Soul Knife are monks who have learned to harnass and focus their ki, using their inner will and focus to control psionic powers - primarily into a blade of pure Psionic power: a Soul Knife.</p>
            <h5>SOULKNIFE QUIRKS</h5>
            <p>The following are some optional quirks for a player of this Way.</p>

                <tr><td>1</td><td>You carry around a bladeless sword hilt for your Soul Knife blade.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You occasionally attempt to cut fruit with your Soul Knife.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>You refer to your actions as the will of the living Ki.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You view killing things with your psionic powers as evil, but killing things with your Soul Knife as perfectly okay.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You have endless platitudes about temperance and control.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You practice obscure martial art form stances every morning.</td></tr>

                <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve learned to focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create multiple blades, but any blade you are not holding vanishes at the end of your turn and must be resummoned.</p>
                <p class="indent">Regardless of the form it takes, the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the light, finesse, and thrown(20/60) properties.</p>
