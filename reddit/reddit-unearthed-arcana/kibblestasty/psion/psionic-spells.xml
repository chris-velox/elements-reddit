        <description>
            <p>You focus your telepathic powers on a creature and ask it a question. It must make an Intelligence saving throw, or it conjures a short mental thought or image that answers your question to the best of its ability that you can perceive telepathically. If a character passes a saving throw against this ability, they have advantage on saving throws against it for next 24 hours.</p>

            <p>You you create an exact duplicate of yourself within 30 feet of you. It has all of your stats, abilities, and equipment, but you can only choose one to any of your magical items. It acts on your initiative, and has its own actions. It has its own hit points equal to your current hit points when you cast it, but shares your Psi Points, spell slots, and Innate Psionics feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the start of your next turn, pick which is the real you between the two versions. The other one disappears and its essence returns to you, and you gain all memories it gained as your own. If one version dies before the spell ends, you are the version that did not die. Whichever version is you at the end of the spell has all of your magical items.</p>

            <p>You project an ethereal creation from your mind taking the shape of a medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack; so long as it does not move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack, on a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend Psi Points up to your per use limit to issue commands that effect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you cannot exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Strike (2 psi point):</b> The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Relocate (1 psi point):</b> The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Solidify (1 psi point):</b> You construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is not in another creatures space. It has an armor class of 16, and hit points of your Intelligence modifier + your Psion level. The construct etheral again if it drops to zero hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Grab (1 psi point):</b> Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained. At the end of the creatures turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends of the construct becomes ethereal again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Grow (1 psi points):</b> Your construct by a size, and its damage increased by one die. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn unless you use Sustain. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Replicate (3 psi points):</b> You use Relocate, but the original does not disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another constructs and control both with the same action (commands only effect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Sustain (1+ psi point):</b> At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command an additional round. This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining solidify refreshes the constructs hit points to its maximum.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You can use your mind to create a burst of elemental power, blasting a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each die of cold damage dealt, the creature’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn, for each die of fire damage dealt by the original attack, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its next turn, and for each die of lightning damage dealt, an arc of lightning strikes another creature of your choice within 20 feet, dealing 1d4 lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can spend Psi Points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Amplifed (1+ psi points):</b> The target takes an additional 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Lasting (1 psi point):</b> Your Elemental Blast leaves a 5 foot radius sphere of devestating behind where it strikes until the start of your next turn. Creatures that enter this zone for the first time or end their turn in it must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the secondary effects (slow, burn, arc) of the blast as if they haed been hit by it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Massive (1-3 psi points):</b> You unleash a massive blast; rather than making an attack roll, all creatures within a 15 foot cone must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On failure, they take the effect as if hit by the Elemental Blast. The size of the cone is doubled for each point up to 3 spent (2 points for 30 feet, 3 points for 60 feet).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Overcharged (0 psi point):</b> You take 1 force damage and do not add your Proficiency modifier from the attack or Spell Save DC for your Elemental Blast, but increase the damage it deals by twice your Proficiency modifier.</p>
