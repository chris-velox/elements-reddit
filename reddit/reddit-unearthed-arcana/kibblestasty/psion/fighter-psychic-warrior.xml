            <p>A Psionic Warrior is a Fighter who is deadly in both mind and body, lethal in both thought and action. Gifted, blessed, cursed, burdened, or born with Psionic powers, when these powers manifest upon taking this archetype, the Fighter transitions into a terrifying foe, unbounded by any natural laws.</p>

                <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your psionic powers manifest, allowing you warp and bend reality with your mind. These powers are fueled by psi points.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Powers:</strong> You learn three powers of your choice, which are detailed under "Powers" below. Some powers enhance an attack in some way. You can only use one power per attack.</p>
                <p class="indent">You learn two additional powers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn powers, you can also replace one power you know with a different one.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Psi Points:</strong> You have three psi points. A psi point is expanded when you use it. You regain all your expended psi points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain another psi point at 7th level, and one more at 15th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Some of your powers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the power’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Psionic Power save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

                    <h5 class="caption">Psion Integration</h5>
                    <p>The Psionic Warrior has a grab-bag Psionic Features appropriate to a Fighter that dabbles in Psionics. Some of its features resemble counter parts in the Psion, and its Psi Points are compatible with the Psionic Powers of the Psion, sharing a pool should a character have both.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For the purposes of the Psionic Mind Feat, the Psionic Warrior is considered to have a Psionic discipline, though does not meet the prerequisite of any talent that requires one.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you can manipulate small objects within 30 feet with your mind as if using your hand to interact with it. You can use this power to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You cannot Attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds in this manner. You can move an item you are controlling in this way up to 30 feet during your turn.</p>
