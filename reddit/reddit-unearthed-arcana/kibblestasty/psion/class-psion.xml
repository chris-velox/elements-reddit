        <description>
            <p>A large orc is flung across the room, smashing through tables and chairs before hitting the wall with a thunderous crash, collapsing dazed. A human, her eyes still glowingwith unearthly power, tosses a few extra coins on the bar. "Sorry for themess. If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time".</p>
            <p class="indent">The prisoner’s expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden, recalling where he stashed the loot. "Under the stables behind the Rusty Hook Inn" the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief’s expression becomes terrified.</p>
            <p class="indent">"Ain’t you... cold or somethin’?" the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. "I just think ’warm’" the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... they haven’t frozen to death yet. "Say... could you think some ’warm’ this way?" the dwarf asks hopefully. To the dwarfs surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely "that’s downright creepy... hey don’t stop now! Was jus’ sayin’ it was creepy."</p>
            <p class="indent">Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.</p>
            <p class="indent">The exact nature of what is Psionic power might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view Psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist - anything from the leaking power of the Far Realm, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individuals will upon the world.</p>
            <h4>POWERFUL MINDS</h4>
            <p>Since a psion’s weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may effect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?</p>
            <h4>MISUNDERSTOOD POWER</h4>
            <p>In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a Psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality their will. But even among magic users, a Psion’s powers will frequently be found unnerving.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is often those who do understand magic that find a Psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PSION</h4>
            <p>When creating a Psion, consider your character’s background. How did you become a Psion? Were you born with latent powers? Or did something happen to you granting your powers? Or did you intentionally train yourself through rigorous mental exercise to leverage them? Consider how developing a rare and mysterious power would have affected your interactions with people.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider what your purpose is with your newfound powers, or how you plan to use your powers. Do you intend to be taken for a Wizard casting magic, or are you freely open about being of a... different nature?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the Acolyte, Far Traveler or Hermit background.</p>

                <h5>PSIONIC DISCIPLINES</h5>
                <p>You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character’s capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with Psi Points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.</p>
                <p class="indent">Psionic powers are suppressed by anti-magic fields and can be dispelled with <em>dispel magic</em>, but are only affected by <em>counterspell</em> if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or identify a spell being cast with Psionics is made at disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The spell <em>detect magic</em> will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature - it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.</p>
                <p class="indent">When recreating a spell through a Psionic effect (using a Psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no Material or Verbal components, but always requires Somatic components and causes the Psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.</p>
                <h5>PSI POINTS</h5>
                <p class="indent">Starting at 1st level, you gain access to Psi Points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of Psi Points equal to your Psion level, and regain all spent points after completing a short or long rest. You can spend a number of Psi Points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time (for example, at level 5, you can spend 3 psi points on psionic power or cast a spell with cost of 3 psi points).</p>
                <h5>PSIONIC ABILITY</h5>
                <p class="indent">Psionic powers, psionic talents, and spells gained through this class use your Psionic ability.</p>

        <description>
            <p>An Awakened is a Psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the Far Realm in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of creature that did not belong walking down the street.</p>
            <p class="indent">An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest - telepathy - is one of the most feared and shunned abilities, often viewed for its rather creepy potential.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil. Knowing what is on the minds of others affects people in different ways, driving some away from society as they see its true face, while others feel drawn to help the problems only they can see.</p>

        <description>
            <p>An Unleashed Psion’s power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers they grant fully.</p>
            <p class="indent">What the wellspring of their innate power is varies - they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken, an Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.</p>

            <p>A Transcended Psion is most often one that has found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind’s eye.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcended the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.</p>
            <p class="indent">Transcended Psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come to understanding of the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other Psions may have. Unfortunately less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Transcended Psion as a bit... peculiar.</p>
