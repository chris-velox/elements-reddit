                <h4>ASSASSIN QUIRKS</h4>
                <p>The following are some optional quirks for an Assassin</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><td>d6</td><td>Quirk</td></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tr><td>1</td><td>Life is cheap, death is expensive. You kill what you are paid to kill. Only.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2</td><td>You have perfected the art of standing motionless. It doesn’t make you invisible, but some people find it creepy.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3</td><td>You are always fiddling with something sharp.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>4</td><td>Life is suffering. You are an angel of mercy.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5</td><td>Job satisfaction is important. You enjoy your work.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>6</td><td>You have a code you follow zealously that dictates who you can kill.</td></tr>
                </table>
                <h4>ADDITIONAL WEAPONS</h4>
                <h5 class="caption">MARTIAL WEAPON</h5>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><td>Weapon</td><td>Price</td><td>Damage</td><td>Weight</td><td>Properties</td></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tr><td>Garrote</td><td>1 sp</td><td>-</td><td>1/4 lb.</td><td>Two-handed, Finesse, Special</td></tr>
                </table>
                <h5 class="caption">GARROTE</h5>
                <p>A garrote has disadvantage when making attacks, unless the target is surprised. A large or smaller creature hit by a garrote is grappled. While a creature is grappled in this way, it is muted, and has its current and maximum hit points reduced by 2d6 at the start of its turn. A creature that does not need to breath doesn’t have their hit points reduced, but is still grappled.</p>
                <p class="indent">A creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal, but the grappling character can use Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) when attempting to maintain the grapple. If a creature breaks free of the grapple before being reduced to zero hit points, their maximum hit points return to normal, and they regain half the hit points lost.</p>
                <p class="indent">The grapple automatically ends at the start of the grappling creature’s next turn unless they use their action to maintain the grapple. You cannot make attacks while maintaining this grapple.</p>
