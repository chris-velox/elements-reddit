        <description>
            <p>Two vast armies stand across the field of death, fear gripping the heart of every soldier. From their ranks, the banner is carried forth - a shining beacon without fear. Before they even know it, their feet pound across the ground, their fear left behind as they follow their symbol of hope to victory.</p>
            <p class="indent">Collapsing to the ground, a man succumbs to wounds, exhaustion, terror, and the overwhelming clash of steel all around. Death closes in, but before it can claim him, a hand appears, pulling him to his feet. &quot;On your feet, solider&quot;.</p>
            <p class="indent">The line was about to be overwhelmed, the inevitable break would come, for the soldiers could hold no more. Until, among their ranks, they noticed their liege, unwilling to turn aside. Unwilling to step back from danger, and the men realized that retreat was no longer an option, and not a step backwards was taken. A new strength was found behind every blow and they fought as no man has ever fought before.</p>
            <p class="indent">Everywhere the enemy probed, they met only a wall of spears and a rain of arrows. Every flanking maneuver flanked, every bluff called and every gambit a failure. The foes could do naught but curse the luck that had turned against them. But there was a man that made that luck with one brilliant tactical decision after another, and his men knew that as long as he was by their side, luck would always abandon their foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Warlord is a force multiplier for their companions. Some of them may be fearsome combatants, while others may never lift a weapon, but in either case their presence on the battlefield will drive their companions to new heights, guiding them through what would surely have been their doom safely.</p>
            <p class="indent">How this is brought about can vary, from inciting crazed zeal to tempering an overeager charge, from turning a rout into an unbreakable last stand to pulling their companions out of the line of danger in the nick of time. The sole commonality is that a Warlord alone is but a man, while a Warlord with their companions is a legend.</p>
            <h4>PURPOSE AND DRIVE</h4>
            <p>A common element to those that walk the path of a Warlord is a purpose. One which gives them a larger-than-life presence and allows them to be a guiding hand to all those around them. Some Warlords may not seek any particular cause, and merely seek victory - either as a tribute to a god they worship or simply to meet a personal achievement. More often, though, a Warlord is driven by a higher purpose - a loyalty to their country or their men, a drive to protect the innocent or to crush the weak.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is an important consideration to a Warlord in understanding why they fight, as it will inform how they fight. Do they try to keep their companions and followers out of danger? Or do they simply press for the strategy that is most likely to win?</p>
            <h4>CREATING A WARLORD</h4>
            <p>When creating a Warlord you should always start with answering the question: what sort of Presence does this person bring to battlefield? Are they are a charismatic inspiration to their allies that drives them to fight on? Are they a wise veteran who acts as a force multiplier for their companions, offering pointers and grit? Or are they a scheming manipulator who sees one step ahead of any move their foes can make, always making sure their allies are in the right spot?</p>
            <p class="indent">Any of these paths and many more are all possible through the Warlord, but what sort of Presence you select at level one will guide what attribute is most impactful for you in exerting your influence and driving your companions to greater heights.</p>
            <h4>QUICK BUILD</h4>
            <p>You can make an warlord quickly by following these suggestions. For a Chieftain or Paragon select Strength as your highest attribute followed by Charisma. For a Commander select Strength as your highest attribute followed by Wisdom.</p>
            <p class="indent">For a Noble select Charisma as your highest attribute followed by Constitution, and for a Tactician select Intelligence followed by Constitution.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you have access to Leadership Dice. These represent your ability to focus your battlefield presence to powerful results. Your Warlord level determines the number and size of the dice, as shown on the Leadership Dice column of the Warlord table. You can spend these to fuel various features.</p>
            <p class="indent">You start knowing three such features: Rallying Mark, Overwhelm, and Helpful Word. When you get this feature, you can spend one Leadership Die per turn. Starting at 6th level, you can spend two Leadership Dice per turn. The number you can expend increases at 11th level (to three dice), and again at 17th level (to four dice).</p>
            <p class="indent">A Leadership Die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended Leadership Dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <h5>RALLYING MARK</h5>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can expend a number of Leadership Dice (up to your per turn limit) to mark a hostile creature within 60 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">On the next damage roll made against this target by an ally before the start of your next turn, add the Leadership Dice spent to the damage roll, and the attacking creature regains hit points equal to amount rolled on the Leadership Dice.</p>
            <h5>OVERWHELMING MARK</h5>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can expend a number of Leadership Dice (up to your per turn limit) to mark a hostile creature within 60 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">The next time that creature is hit by an attack by an allied creature before the start of your next turn, the opening is exploited, and the creature is staggered until the end of its next turn. A staggered creature's movement speed is halved, it cannot take reactions, and it has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell; if you spend two or more Leadership Dice, it also has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws while staggered, and if you spend three or more Leadership Dice it also makes one fewer attacks when using its action to take the attack or multiattack action (minimum one) while staggered.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time the staggered creature takes damage (including the staggering hit), up to a number of times equal to the Leadership Dice spent, it takes additional damage equal to a Leadership Die.</p>
            <h5>HELPFUL WORD</h5>
            <p>You can spend a Leadership Die to take the Help action as a bonus action on your turn. When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you</p>

            <p>A Commander on the field can be many things - a trusted Sergeant, a weary Veteran, or merely a man with an uncommon degree of common sense and a particularly keen eye for how to win a fight.</p>
            <p class="indent">While not as flashy as some of the other Presences on the Battlefield, that just means they are less likely to get themselves skewered. A keen word there and helping hand here, their influence is subtle but effective, inexorably shifting the tides of battle in their favor.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Commander can come from any background, but is usually someone that has acquired their Wisdom the hard way, having seen a bit of what life and battlefields have to offer.</p>

            <p>A Warlord with a Noble Presence is not inherently one that was born a Noble, though many are. A Noble Presence Warlord is one that serves to drive their retainers and companions onto greater heights through sheer charisma, a shining beacon of what they are fighting for standing beside them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Since time immemorial men have fought twice as hard on a battlefield when their leader takes the field to stand among them, driven to heights that would seem impossible in order to protect their liege - while an adventurer of this path may or may not be their liege, their charisma invokes the same fervor in their companions and retainers.</p>
            <p class="indent">An adventurer on this path is not inherently of noble background, though many often are. A noble reared on the laws of the land is usually lawful, but extraordinary circumstances may have brought about a rebellious streak in one that now seeks to overthrow unfit rulers (or rulers that aren’t them, anyway).</p>

        <description>
            <p>While Warlords may specialize in the control of battles, n Packleader is a Warlord that aims to win a fight before it becomes a battle. Through scouting, preparing, and stacking the odds, they don’t fight fair, they fight to win, and seek to only fight when they’ve already won.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their control of the battlefield doesn’t merely extend to those that fight on it, but to twisting the battlefield itself to suit their needs, stymying and stupefying their foes while concealing and sheltering their allies with the terrain itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">While good and evil rarely play directly into a Packleader’s perspective (they can be either or Neutral just as easily), they tend be Chaotic, viewing the so called &quot;rules of engagement&quot; and other traditions of civilization to be convenient weaknesses they can exploit rather than any sort of guideline they might actually follow.</p>

            <p>Legends tell of warriors that fight at the front of a legion, of the valor they display and the inspiration it gives their comrades. A Paragon before their army is a dauntless foe, and an army behind their Paragon is an unstoppable legion.</p>

            <p>A Tactician may very well tell you they would just as soon not be close enough to the battle to be considered a combatant, preferring to win their fights before it ever gets to that stage, but one would be a fool to underestimate how dangerous they are once on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">While they might have laid their plans in advance, their sharp minds can quickly pick apart how their foes try to fight against them and effortlessly pierce the crude tactics that would be used against them and their allies.</p>
            <p class="indent">What tends to mark a Tactician is a keen mind and a willingness to plan ahead... in great detail. Adventurers with a tactician among them are near impossible to pin down, as they will always find a way to turn the tables.</p>
